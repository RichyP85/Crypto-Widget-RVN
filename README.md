# Known Issues
- RainRGB.exe, program used to change color of fonts, triggers AVG antivirus on my PC. No issues with program thus far.
	- Will look into updating the program to one that does not bring in a false positive on my antivirus.
- After performing several adjustments and tweaks to code, the skin will stop reporting hashrates and prices. I have had to un-load skin and exit Rainmeter all together to correct issue.
	- Issue rarely happens, might be issue with Rainmeter itself.

Skin is a simple version of Unse's work, the layout was perfect and the code was easy to follow. I only needed a widget
for quick feedback of pool hashrates and balances, so the extra difficulty, block time, and profit measures were not for me.

Used the code for his setup screen to control the colors and change the address and payout for this skin.
Also utilized the same RainRGB.exe program that he had used.
His skin was beautiful and well designed, check it out.

Balance bar was a simple addition I had learned through various resources. 

This is my first GitHub repository and first time working on a project like this. If you have any feedback or tips for me, please let me know.
I've tried to keep the licensing and credits to show the respect for the work where its due, but if I missed something, or have offended, please let me know.
